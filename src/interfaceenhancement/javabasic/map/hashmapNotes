hashmap internal work flow-->>
1.when a HM is created it will be in default capacity which is 16. it will create 15 buckets(which is 0 index to 15)
2.each buckets consider as linked list & linked list contains one node.
3.node stucher is like Key,Value,hash,next
4.when we put duplicate key ,internaly it will check .equals(). to comparesion.
5.if each bucket having multiple node that is called hashing cohesion.
